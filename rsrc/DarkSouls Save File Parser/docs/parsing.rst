010 Editor
----------
010 Editor has binary templates which are pretty nice and powerful helping to see data in human way.

You should pick ``DarkSouls_PTDE.bt`` as template and open DRAKS0005.sl2 file then
press F5 or just run template over file to tree data and data which had been
already parsed.

.. note::

    All data inside templates used to be correct, so prefer template data
    than old data sheet ones which has some mistakes.
